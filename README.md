# anime_recommendations_back

A backend application for recommending anime based on user preferences

## Recommendation System

The recommendation system provides anime recommendations based on the user's preferences

Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. **Data Retrieval**:

   - **Redis Cache**: The system first checks Redis to see if recommendations are already cached. If so, it quickly returns these cached recommendations.
   - **Database Query**: If no cached recommendations exist, it queries all anime that the user has liked.

2. **Feature Extraction**:

   - **Genres**: The system creates a genre vector, assigning 1 for present genres and 0 for absent ones

   - **Episodes and Air Date**: The system calculates the standard deviation for the number of episodes and air dates from user-selected anime to find anime of the same duration and release period

3. **Recommendation Generation**:

   - **Filtering**: It filters out anime already in the userâ€™s favorites and limits recommendations to similar episode counts and air dates.
   - **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates similarity based on genre vectors and synopsis content using cosine similarity for more relevant recommendations

4. **Caching**: After calculating recommendations, it stores the result in Redis with a TTL of 24h

5. **Response**: Finally, the system returns a list of recommended anime to the user.
